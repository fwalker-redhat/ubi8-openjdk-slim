| Podman and Buildah for Docker users
| https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/02/21/podman-and-buildah-for-docker-users/

| Get Started with Docker
| https://www.docker.com/get-started

| Build and run your image
| https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/
|===========================

== Steps
. Clone this repository
. Edit any of the files to customize the image to your needs
. Build the image
. Tag the image and push to private image registry

== Environment Variables
The following environment variables provide configuration for runtime of the image. All variables are optional as sensible defaults are calculated at runtime including auto-discovery of a single *jar* artifact if coppied to the _/deployments_ folder

[options="header",cols="3"]
|===========================
| Variable Name
| Description
| Example

| AB_JOLOKIA_AUTH_OPENSHIFT
| Switch on client authentication for OpenShift TLS communication. The value of this parameter can be a relative distinguished name which must be contained in a presented client certificate. Enabling this parameter will automatically switch Jolokia into https communication mode. The default CA cert is set to /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
| true

| AB_JOLOKIA_CONFIG
| If set uses this file (including path) as Jolokia JVM agent properties (as described in Jolokia’s reference manual). If not set, the /opt/jolokia/etc/jolokia.properties file will be created using the settings as defined in this document, otherwise the rest of the settings in this document are ignored.
| /opt/jolokia/custom.properties

| AB_JOLOKIA_DISCOVERY_ENABLED
| Enable Jolokia discovery. Defaults to false.
| true

| AB_JOLOKIA_HOST
| Host address to bind to, the default address is 0.0.0.0.
| 127.0.0.1

| AB_JOLOKIA_HTTPS
| Switch on secure communication with https. By default self-signed server certificates are generated if no serverCert configuration is given in AB_JOLOKIA_OPTS. NOTE: If the values is set to an empty string, https is turned off. If the value is set to a non empty string, https is turned on.
| true

| AB_JOLOKIA_OFF
| If set disables activation of Jolokia (i.e. echos an empty value). By default, Jolokia is enabled. NOTE: If the values is set to an empty string, https is turned off. If the value is set to a non empty string, https is turned on.
| true

| AB_JOLOKIA_OPTS
| Additional options to be appended to the agent configuration. They should be given in the format "key=value, key=value, …​ "
| backlog=20

| AB_JOLOKIA_PASSWORD
| Password for basic authentication. By default authentication is switched off.
| mypassword

| AB_JOLOKIA_PASSWORD_RANDOM
| If set, a random value is generated for AB_JOLOKIA_PASSWORD, and it is saved in the /opt/jolokia/etc/jolokia.pw file.
| true

| AB_JOLOKIA_PORT
| Port to use (Default: 8778)
| 5432

| AB_JOLOKIA_USER
| User for basic authentication. Defaults to 'jolokia'
| myusername

| CONTAINER_CORE_LIMIT
| A calculated core limit as described in CFS Bandwidth Control
| 2

| CONTAINER_MAX_MEMORY
| Memory limit given to the container. This value must be in bytes.
| 536870912 (which results into -Xmx256 (default ratio is 50%))

| GC_ADAPTIVE_SIZE_POLICY_WEIGHT
| The weighting given to the current Garbage Collection (GC) time versus previous GC times.
| 90

| GC_MAX_HEAP_FREE_RATIO
| Maximum percentage of heap free after GC to avoid shrinking.
| 40

| GC_MAX_METASPACE_SIZE
| The maximum metaspace size.
| 100

| GC_MIN_HEAP_FREE_RATIO
| Minimum percentage of heap free after GC to avoid expansion.
| 20

| GC_TIME_RATIO
| Specifies the ratio of the time spent outside the garbage collection (for example, the time spent for application execution) to the time spent in the garbage collection.
| 4

| HTTP_PROXY
| The location of the http proxy, this will be used for both Maven builds and Java runtime
| 127.0.0.1:8080

| http_proxy
| The location of the http proxy, this takes precedence over HTTP_PROXY and will be used for the Java runtime
| http://127.0.0.1:8080

| HTTPS_PROXY
| The location of the https proxy, this takes precedence over http_proxy and HTTP_PROXY and will be used for the Java runtime
| myuser@127.0.0.1:8080

| https_proxy
| The location of the https proxy, this takes precedence over http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, and HTTPS_PROXY and will be used for the Java runtime
| myuser:mypass@127.0.0.1:8080

| JAVA_APP_DIR
| The directory where the application resides. All paths in your application are relative to this directory.
| myapplication/

| JAVA_APP_JAR
| A jar file with an appropriate manifest so that it can be started with Java -jar if no JAVA_MAIN_CLASS is set. In all cases this jar file is added to the classpath, too.
| 

| JAVA_APP_NAME
| Name to use for the process
| demo-app

| JAVA_ARGS
| Arguments passed to the Java application
| hello_world

| JAVA_CLASSPATH
| The classpath to use. If JAVA_LIB_DIR is set, the startup script checks for a file JAVA_LIB_DIR/classpath. If it is not set, the startup script checks for a file JAVA_APP_DIR/classpath and use its content as classpath. If this file doesn’t exists all jars in the application directory are added (classes:JAVA_APP_DIR/*).
| 

| JAVA_DEBUG
| If set remote debugging will be switched on
| true

| JAVA_DEBUG_PORT
| Port used for remote debugging. Default: 5005
| 9009

| JAVA_LIB_DIR
| Directory holding the Java jar files as well an optional classpath file which holds the classpath. Either as a single-line classpath (colon separated) or with jar files listed line-by-line. If not set JAVA_LIB_DIR is the same as JAVA_APP_DIR.
| 

| JAVA_MAIN_CLASS
| A main class to use as argument for Java. When this environment variable is given, all jar files in JAVA_APP_DIR are added to the classpath as well as JAVA_LIB_DIR.
| com.example.MyMainClass

| JAVA_MAX_MEM_RATIO
| It is used when no -Xmx option is given in JAVA_OPTIONS. This is used to calculate a default maximal Heap Memory based on a containers restriction. If used in a Docker container without any memory constraints for the container then this option has no effect. If there is a memory constraint then -Xmx is set to a ratio of the container available memory as set here. The default is 50 which means 50% of the available memory is used as an upper boundary. You can skip this mechanism by setting this value to 0 in which case no -Xmx option is added.
| 40

| JAVA_OPTIONS
| JVM options passed to the Java command
| -verbose:class

| NO_PROXY
| A comma-separated lists of hosts, IP addresses or domains that can be accessed directly, this will be used for both Maven builds and Java runtime
| foo.example.com,bar.example.com

| no_proxy
| A comma-separated lists of hosts, IP addresses or domains that can be accessed directly, this takes precedence over NO_PROXY and will be used for both Maven builds and Java runtime
| *.example.com

== Exposed Ports
[options="header",cols="2"]
|===========================
| Port
| Description

| 8080
| Default port for *HTTP* access to deployed Java application

| 8443
| Default port for *HTTPS* access to deployed Java application

| 8778
| Default port for *Jolokia*

|===========================

== Usage

=== Creating Initial Base Image
* Build the Image
+
[source, bash]
----
$ podman build -t <image-name>:<tag> . <1>
----
<1> Local image tag can be specified by providing *-t* flag

* Tag Image
+
[source, bash]
----
$ podman tag <image-name>:<tag> \ <1>
  <private-registry-url[:port]>/<image-name>:<tag> <2>  
----
<1> Image to apply the tag to
<2> Tag to be applied to the private registry image

* Push Image to Private Registry
+
[source, bash]
----
$ podman push <private-registry-url[:port]>/<image-name>:<tag>
----

=== Using Base Image
* Package the Java artifact using preferred build tool
* Create Dockerfile with a COPY instruction copying the artifact/s to _/deplyoment_ and changing ownership to container user _1001_
* Use resultant image 

.Sample Dockerfile
[source,yaml]
----
FROM <private-registry-url[:port]>/<image>:<tag> <1>
COPY --chown=1001:root <path-to-java-artifact>  /deployments/ <2>
----
<1> Specify base image location
<2> Copy Java artifacts to target directory and change ownership to non-privileged user
